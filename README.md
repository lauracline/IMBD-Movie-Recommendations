# IMBD-Movie-Recommendations
This project aimed to create movie recommendation system modeled after Netflix using the IMBD Movie Lens Dataset. The dataset I used here came directly from IMBD. It consists of four text data files, each file contains over 20M rows. All together, over 70,000 movies and 500,000 users. 

One of the major challenges is to get all this data loaded into a Kernal for analysis. 

A also implemented random exploration, stoplists, identified and eliminated outliers, and considered the risk of filter bubbles, fraud, and value-aware recommendations. 

My objective was to learn from the data and recommend best movies to users, based on self and other's behaviour. 

I used a variety of different algorithms to create this recommender system including: 

1. Building a Recommender Engine Architecture:
  
 a. surpriselib (AlgoBase)
 
 b. Recommender Metrics 
 
 c. Evaluation Data
 
 d. Evaluator
 
 2. Evaluation Methods
  
  a. Train/test and cross-validation
  
  b. Accuracy Metrics (RMSE and MAE)
  
  c. Top-N Hit Rate
  
  d. Coverage, diversity and novelty
  
  e. Churn, responsiveness, and A/B Testing

3. Content-Based Filtering 
  
  a. Cosine similarity metric
  
  b. KNN
  
  c. Mise-en-scene recommendations 

4. Neighbourhood-Based Collaborative Filtering 
  
  a. Similarity Metrics
  
  b. User-based collaborative filtering
  
  c. Item-based collaborative filtering 
  
  d. Hit-Rate
  
  4. KNN
  
  5. Translation-based recommendations 

5. Matrix-Factorization Methods
  
  a. PCA
  
  b. SVD
  
  c. Sparse Linear Methods (SLIM)

6. Deep Learning 
  
  a. RBMs
  
  b. RNNs
  
  4. GRU4Rec

7. Hyrbid Algoritms
